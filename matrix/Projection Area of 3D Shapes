You are given an n x n grid where we place some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.
Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of the cell (i, j).
We view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.
A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. 
We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.
Return the total area of all three projections.

class Solution:
    def projectionArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        summ = 0
        """for XY projection"""
        for row in grid:
            for column in row:
                if column > 0:
                    summ += 1
        
        """for XZ projection"""
        for row in grid:
            summ += max(row)

        """for YZ projection"""
        for column in range(len(grid[0])):
            maxx = 0
            for row in grid:
                maxx = max(maxx, row[column])
            summ += maxx
        return summ
        
1. The function takes a 2D list called grid as input.
2. A variable called summ is initialized to 0 to store the sum of the areas of the projections.
3. The first projection is the XY projection, which is the sum of the number of non-zero elements in each cell of the grid. 
   This is done using two nested loops that iterate over each element in the grid, and if the element is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the summ variable.
4. The second projection is the XZ projection, which is the sum of the maximum value in each row of the grid. 
   This is done by iterating over each row of the grid, and adding the maximum value in the row to the summ variable.
5. The third projection is the YZ projection, which is the sum of the maximum value in each column of the grid. 
   This is done by iterating over each column of the grid, and for each column, iterating over each row to find the maximum value in that column, 
   and adding it to the summ variable.
6. Finally, the function returns the summ variable, which contains the sum of the areas of all three projections.
